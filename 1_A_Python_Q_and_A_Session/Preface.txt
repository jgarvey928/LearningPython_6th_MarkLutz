Preface
If you’re browsing a bookstore and trying to make sense of this book, try this:
Python is one of the most widely used programming languages in the
world. It’s part of nearly every role that computers play in our lives, and
its relative ease of use makes it an ideal way to get started with
programming.
This book is a tutorial that teaches Python language fundamentals in
depth. Its content is aimed at Python newcomers of all stripes, applies to
every role that Python plays, and is based on decades of feedback from
real learners like you.
This edition updates this book for a decade of changes in Python and its
world. It drops coverage of the now-defunct Python 2.X, explores new
tools added to Python through version 3.12, and applies to other
Pythons past and future.
The rest of this preface provides more background info on this book and its
subject. It explains what’s changed since the prior edition, debuts the book’s
examples package, and may help you get oriented before jumping into details.
